IPython Plugin for NINJA-IDE
===============================

Version:
********
0.15 First released version.

Why?
****
Because I work with IPython in a daily basic and I think that it would be a great to get a plugin for NINJA-IDE.

How?
****
I use qwebkit module to get a minimal browser to embed it into a plugin, provided the support given by the NINJA-IDE API.
I started to write some code to get a functional working prototype. Later, I found devicenzo coded by Roberto Alsina and I take some code to improve the previous one. 
Now, I have a version (this one, 0.15) ready to release to the public, so here it is...

Requirements
************
NINJA-IDE >= 2.0
IPython >= 1.0
PyQT >= 4.9 (the plugin is not working with PyQt 4.8 because qwebkit module do not support the correct web socket protocol.

Usage
*****
In a terminal type:
$ ipython notebook --no-browser

in any directory you want, remember you will be able to navigate down from that directory.

Then starts NINJA-ide
